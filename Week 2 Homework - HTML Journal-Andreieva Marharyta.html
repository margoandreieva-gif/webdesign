<h1>About me</h1>
<p>For me, every semester I get more and more experience in college - not only in design skills. Overall, education gives you experience in your life, this a part of my life now: going to work and school, do my assignments and also draw my watercolor illustrations when I have time. I expect after college find another job, where I can work on commercials, I really love motion design and video editing. But, for that I need to learn basics, which I believe are graphic design. Web design I think it's also important, because the more I know the better for me. </p>
<p>As I mentioned before I draw watercolor illustrations. I like to draw some episodes from my life or some interesting events. All my works have a lot of details and I try to work on emotions, because I think it will give more life to my characters. I don't know if this will become my career maybe later. I like do graphic design, but I think doing art would be less stressful for me.  </p>
<p>I'm 23<br>I'm from Kyiv, Ukraine<br>I speak Ukrainian, English and Russian.</p>
